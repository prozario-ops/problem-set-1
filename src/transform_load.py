PART 2: Merge and transform the data
- Read in the two datasets from /data into two separate dataframes
- Profile, clean, and standardize date fields for both as needed
- Merge the two dataframe for the date range 10/1/2024 - 10/31/2025
- Conduct EDA to understand the relationship between weather and transit ridership over time
-- Create a line plot of daily transit ridership and daily average temperature over the whole time period
-- For February 2025, create a scatterplot of daily transit ridership vs. precipitation
-- Create a correlation heatmap of all numeric features in the merged dataframe
-- Load the merged dataframe as a CSV into /data
-- In a print statement, summarize any interesting trends you see in the merged dataset
